 * Basic class that contains some stuff all stored entities have in common
 *

 * 
 * Not used as an object on its own, but more specific entities will extend 
 * this class. Extenders must set the id, table name and container 
 * themselves. 
 * 
 * The container is used for propagating changes upwards. When a subentity
 * changes, it propagates the change information up to its container. That
 * way, the top level entity knows when a part of it has changed.
