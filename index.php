/**
 * General todo list:
 * 
 * Later:
 * 
 * - refresh stylesheet after changing styles (use an event for this)
 * 
 * - don't factor/show an empty structure when a position object isn't shown (because it is deleted or because of permissions) -> put the factored position structure in the cache of the child object (and adjust the outdate-function accordingly)
 * 
 * - create full copy/update statements in the store in executeupdatestatements, reducing the number of update queries for speed optimization
 * 
 * - copy the copyright message to all files
 * 
 * - use searchable children indicator to also edit and publish children with their parent. This helps to 
 * create a seamless experience when adding texts, pictures, etc to a content container. (and later on also share/give)
 * 
 * - create multi upload that adds multiple searchable children
 * 
 * - handle errors and messages in the frontend, decide when to gives errors, and when messages
 * 
 * - respond (add a specified template)
 * 
 * - respond for anonymous users (update the object authorization for view/add/edit, as specified in the todo in authorization.php)
 * 
 * - full delete an object when changes are cancelled
 * 
 * - 1. stop users from asking for unlimited resized versions of images, clogging the server and eating away file system space
 * - 2. don't create unlimited copies of files when publishing an item and nothing has been changed
 * 
 * - think of a way to manage div background images
 * 
 * Big things:
 * 
 * - other admin functions: users, user groups, permissions, roles, password, file includes, snippets, settings
 * 
 * - events
 * 
 * - undo, redo, revert, preview site in edit mode
 * 
 * - creating masters structure for templates/lss updates
 * 
 * - creating code update structure
 * 
 * - sharing/giving of content
 * 
 * - create connector to mail (and other things)
 * 
 * - create new sites for bpadsite.nl and bpadcms.nl
 * 
 * 
 * Minor issues:
 * 
 * - if the mobile snippet isn't found, revert to the default snippet (every site should have a mobile snippet)
 * - check the existence of templates to add before showing an add button (only happens while configuring, there should be no add buttons where there are no templates)
 *
